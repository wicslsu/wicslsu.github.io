        <div class="content">
          <p>Two years ago we held our first ever Game Jam and it was a huge success! We had roughly 70 participants, 30+ volunteers, 7 judges, and 6 sponsors. Sponsors had booths at the game jam where students got free swag and networked with top companies. We served breakfast, lunch and dinner which consisted of Chik-Fil-A catering, jambalaya, pizza, and a bunch of snacks to keep the participants fueled. All of the teams who participated created successful games(you can download a few of the games below to check them out!). It was an amazing experience for game developers and code lovers in South Louisiana and we can't wait to share more wonderful experiences with you all again this year!</p>
